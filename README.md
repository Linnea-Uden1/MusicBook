Short Description
MusicBook is a social networking app centered around songs and their lyrics. It provides a platform for users to discover, interact, and share their thoughts on their favorite tracks. After signing up, users are welcomed with a feed showcasing the most recently discussed lyrics or the most popular lines. This creates an engaging entry point, allowing users to see what others are listening to or talking about.

The sidebar acts as the central navigation hub, enabling users to return to the feed, search for songs or artists and explore trending tracks and artists. The search functionality allows users to easily find songs or artists they are interested in.

By selecting a song from the feed or searching for it directly, users can read into its lyrics and listen to the song via spotify. From here, they can interact further by selecting specific lines of the lyrics and writing their own comments, like others comments, sharing their interpretations, feelings or related thoughts.
